In case of divorce, you’ll need to submit separate applications if you sponsor divorced parents and grandparents. If your divorced parents or grandparents have a current spouse, common-law partner or a conjugal partner, these people become dependants on the application and can immigrate to Canada with your parents and grandparents, if approved.

In the application, you can include your brothers and sisters, half-brothers and half-sisters, or step-brothers and step-sisters only if they qualify as dependent children.

You must meet the income requirements for all the people you want to sponsor and their dependants (spouse, partner and dependent children).

The people you sponsor must also be eligible

Your common-law partner
Your common-law partner:

can be either sex
is at least 18 years old

persecution (for example, your relationship is between different religious groups which is not accepted and they may be punished legally or socially)
You’ll need to give proof that you could not live together or get married in your conjugal partner’s country (for example, proof of refused long-term stays in each other’s country).

Dependent children
Children qualify as dependants if they meet both of these requirements:

If you’re sponsoring just your child, without sponsoring your spouse or partner, you’ll name your child as the principal applicant in the application. You’ll have to show that the other parent or legal guardian agrees to your child immigrating to Canada. See your checklist for what you’ll need to provide.
If the child you want to sponsor has a child of their own (your grandchild), you’ll include your grandchild as a dependant in the application.
If you want to sponsor your adopted child or an orphaned family member, follow the instructions to sponsor your adopted child or orphaned family member instead.

To show they meet the eligibility requirements, your spouse, partner, dependent child and their dependent children (if applicable) must provide:

all required forms and documents with their application

You don’t have to stay in an abusive relationship to keep your status in Canada
The person who’s abusing you might tell you that you’ll be deported or lose your children if you leave. If you’re a permanent resident, you have rights and freedoms in Canada.

Under that condition, you had to live with your sponsor to keep permanent resident status. That condition no longer exists, and your status no longer depends on you living with your sponsor.

If you have temporary status in Canada, you also have options.

Program requirements
You can check the criteria for the program you've been invited to apply under to make sure you're still eligible.

Changes to your personal situation
If your situation (or that of your spouse or common-law partner) changes, you should re-calculate your score before applying online for permanent residence.

If your recalculated score is less than the lowest score in your round of invitations, you should decline the invitation. If you decide to apply anyway, we may:

you no longer have a valid job offer
you no longer have a provincial nomination
your language test scores:

If you decline an invitation, you'll be put back into the Express Entry pool of candidates. You'll be considered in future rounds of invitations, if you’re still eligible.

The cut-off score varies from round to round. If your score isn’t high enough, you might not be invited to apply again. In some cases, you may have to take steps to be invited to apply again. For example, you may need to:

improve your score
update your Express Entry profile
There is no guarantee that you'll be invited to apply again. However, if you choose to re-enter the pool, declining an invitation won't affect whether or not you’re invited to apply later.

If you don't decline an invitation and you don't apply within 60 days, the invitation will expire and your profile will be removed from the pool. To be considered in future rounds of invitations you'll have to:

fill out and submit a new Express Entry profile
meet the eligibility
